scientific_python_presentation
==============================

Scientific Python presentation for Python meetup in Denmark (pycon.dk)
to be held on Nov 30th 2012.

To compile the presentation you'll need Landslide.

In bash or similar run: `landslide scientific_python.md`

I'll put a compiled version online just before the meetup.
